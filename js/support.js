/* ============================================================
   PSI support assistant
   Honest by design: every answer comes from copy already on
   this site. The engine below retrieves and ranks that copy;
   it never generates a fact. Anything it cannot ground is
   routed to the phone or the quote form.

   The system:
   - a knowledge base of fine-grained entries, each a fact the
     site states, tagged with the terms people use to ask for it
   - a retrieval engine: normalisation, light stemming, a
     synonym map, weighted term scoring with phrase bonuses and
     an evidence threshold
   - compound questions split and answered part by part
   - conversation persists for the visit (sessionStorage); typing
     paced to answer length and skipped for reduced motion;
     focus is trapped in the open panel
